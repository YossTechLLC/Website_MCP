## ADR-001: Use FastAPI over Flask

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision Makers:** Development Team
**Context:**

The original PayGate Prime uses Flask for the backend. For the MCP test implementation, we need to choose between Flask and FastAPI.

**Decision:**

Use FastAPI instead of Flask for the backend framework.

**Rationale:**

1. **Performance:** FastAPI is built on Starlette/uvicorn with async support, providing better performance for I/O-bound operations
2. **Modern Features:** Native async/await support, automatic API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
3. **Type Safety:** Built-in Pydantic validation provides type-safe request/response handling
4. **Developer Experience:** Automatic data validation, serialization, and documentation generation
5. **Responsiveness Goal:** Async architecture aligns with goal to be more responsive than webhook-based original

**Consequences:**

- Positive: Better performance, modern async patterns, automatic API docs
- Negative: Team may need to learn FastAPI-specific patterns if familiar with Flask
- Neutral: Similar ecosystem to Flask (compatible with most Python libraries)

**Alternatives Considered:**

- Flask: More familiar, but lacks native async support and requires more manual validation
- Express.js: Would require switching entire stack to Node.js
