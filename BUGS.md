### BUG-001: gcloud Missing Python grpc Module
**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Severity:** HIGH
**Discovered:** 2025-10-28
**Component:** Deployment / gcloud CLI

**Description:**
When attempting to run `gcloud run deploy`, encountered error:
```
ERROR: gcloud failed to load (gcloud.run.deploy): Problem loading gcloud.run.deploy: No module named 'grpc'.
```

**Root Cause:**
The system's gcloud installation is missing the Python `grpc` (gRPC) module, which is required for Cloud Run deployments.

**Impact:**
- Cannot deploy backend to Cloud Run
- Cannot deploy frontend to Cloud Run
- Blocks final deployment and testable URL generation

**Attempted Fixes:**
1. Tried `pip3 install grpcio grpcio-tools` - pip3 not available
2. Tried `python3 -m pip install grpcio` - pip module not installed
3. Tried `sudo apt-get install python3-grpcio` - requires password/interactive terminal
4. **CURRENT:** Running `gcloud components reinstall --quiet` to fix installation

**Current Status:**
- gcloud component reinstall in progress (downloading and extracting components)
- Expected resolution time: 5-10 minutes
- Will retry deployment once reinstall completes

**Workaround:**
None available without fixing gcloud installation.

**Resolution Plan:**
1. Wait for gcloud components reinstall to complete
2. Verify grpc module is available
3. Retry backend deployment
4. Retry frontend deployment
